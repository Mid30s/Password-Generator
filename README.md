# Password-Generator

Design a password generator that will provide a password which is limited to be between 8 and 128 characters in length. The user is prompted if they would like to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and/or special characters. Once the user answers each prompt they will be given a unique password on the screen that is tailored to their responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
